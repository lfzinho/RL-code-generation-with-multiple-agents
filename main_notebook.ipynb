       "**Explanation:**\n",
       "\n",
       "1. **Initialization:**\n",
       "   - `fib_sequence = []`: An empty list is created to store the Fibonacci sequence.\n",
       "   - `a = 0`, `b = 1`: The starting values of the sequence (first two Fibonacci numbers) are assigned to variables `a` and `b`.\n",
       "\n",
       "2. **Loop:**\n",
       "   - `for i in range(10):`: A loop iterates 10 times, representing the first 10 elements of the sequence.\n",
       "\n",
       "3. **Calculation and Appending:**\n",
       "   - `fib_sequence.append(a)`: The current value of `a` is added to the `fib_sequence` list.\n",
       "   - `a, b = b, a + b`:  Simultaneously, `a` gets updated to `b`, and `b` is updated to the sum of the previous two numbers (previous `a` and `b`). This effectively calculates the next Fibonacci number in the sequence.\n",
       "\n",
       "4. **Output:**\n",
       "   - `print(\"The first 10 Fibonacci numbers are:\", fib_sequence)`: The list `fib_sequence` containing the first 10 Fibonacci numbers is printed.\n",
       "\n",
       "\n",
       "**How it works:**\n",
       "\n",
