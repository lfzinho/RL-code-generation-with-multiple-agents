The goal is to handle common issues like missing values, inconsistent formatting, and outliers. The code should perform the cleaning step-by-step, detailing any crucial steps each library provides for data analysis. For example, how would you: \n* Handle missing values?\n* Convert date formats?\n* Deal with duplicates or outliers?\nPlease include comments to help understand your implementation."

Identify and handle missing values where appropriate.\n3. Perform data type conversion and normalization as needed.\n4. Optionally, use SQLAlchemy to query an external database for additional data or verification if applicable.\n\nSpecifically, look into potential pandas, dask functionalities, and sqlalchemy integrations for maximum efficiency."
