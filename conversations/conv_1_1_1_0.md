```python
import pandas as pd

# Import the CSV file into a Pandas DataFrame
df = pd.read_csv('csv_data/imdb_sample_10.csv')

# Addressing data issues: 

# 1. Handling Missing Values:
# - Fill in missing values with 'None' for better clarity in analysis
df.fillna(value='None', inplace=True)

# 2. Standardizing Data Format (Runtime): 
#  - Convert Runtime from string to numeric format using pd.to_numeric()
df['Runtime'] = pd.to_numeric(df['Runtime'])


# Cleaning up the data:
# 3. Handling inconsistent naming:
#   - Correct 'Genre' column name for consistency
df.rename(columns={'Genre': 'Movie Genre'}, inplace=True)

# 4.  Standardizing IMDB Rating and Meta_score columns :
#   - Remove 'nan' (Not a Number) values from the rating and meta_score columns to avoid errors in further analysis.
df['IMDB_Rating'] = df['IMDB_Rating'].fillna(0)
df['Meta_score'] = df['Meta_score'].fillna(0)


# 5.  Dealing with inconsistent data types: 
#   - Converting all values that have a type of 'str' to 'float' or 'int' for calculations and analysis
df['Genre'] = df['Genre'].astype(str)

# Save the corrected DataFrame (optional):
df.to_csv('corrected_imdb_sample_data.csv', index=False)



print("Data Corrections Completed!")
``` 


**Explanation of Steps:**
* **Import Libraries:** We start by importing the `pandas` library for data manipulation and analysis.
* **Read CSV File:** The `pd.read_csv()` function reads the content of the 'imdb_sample_10.csv' file into a DataFrame called `df`. 
* **Data Handling and Cleaning:**
    * **Missing Values:** We fill in missing values with 'None' to avoid errors during further analysis. 
    * **Runtime Standardization:** The `pd.to_numeric()` function converts the 'Runtime' column from string to numeric, making it easier for calculations. 
    * **Genre Correction:** This corrects inconsistencies in the 'Genre' column name and standardizes its format.  
    * **IMDB & Meta Score Handling:** We use `.fillna(value=0)` to replace any NaN (not a number) values with zero to handle missing values. These values are then replaced by 0.  
    * **Type Conversion:** This ensures consistency in how 'Genre' is handled for analysis and calculation purposes.


**Further Steps: Analysis & Visualization**

The corrected DataFrame can now be used for further analysis and visualization of the data. Here are a few ideas: 

1. **Movie Genre Distribution:** Use `df['Movie Genre'].value_counts()` to understand the distribution of movies across genres
2. **Visualizations:** Create bar plots, boxplots, or histograms to visualize the relationships between different variables like 'IMDB_Rating', 'Meta_score' and 'Genre'. 


Remember that this code provides a foundational framework for addressing data issues in your dataset. You can adapt it further based on the specific requirements of your analysis and insights you wish to obtain.

try:
    df = pd.read_csv('csv_data/imdb_sample_10.csv')
except FileNotFoundError:
    print("File not found. Please check your file path.")
    exit()


# Address data issues, adding exploratory steps and error handling
# Data Exploration
print(df.head()) # Show first few rows for initial inspection
print(df.describe())  # Get descriptive statistics

#Data Validation & Handling 
try:
    df.duplicated().sum()
except KeyError as e:
    print(f"KeyError: {e}")

# Handling Non-Numeric Data (for illustration purposes, adjust based on your data) 
def check_non_numeric_values(df):  
    for col in df.columns:
        if not all(isinstance(row[col], float) for row in df.itertuples()):
            print(f"WARNING: Non-Numeric Values in Column '{col}'")

check_non_numeric_values(df) # Run check on your data 


#  Adding Error Handling and Comments
try:
    df['Genre'].fillna('Unknown', inplace=True)
except KeyError as e:
    print(f"KeyError: {e}")  
print("Data loaded successfully!")

#  Further Development (example)
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

df.groupby('Genre').mean().plot(kind='bar') 
plt.show()
```


**Explanation of Changes:**

1. **Handling FileNotFound Error**:  We added a `try...except` block to catch file not found errors and provide helpful messages. This helps avoid crashes if the CSV file is missing.
2. **Data Exploration**: `df.head()` provides a quick look at the first few rows of your data, giving you an initial understanding. 
    *  `df.describe()` generates a summary of key statistics for each column (e.g., count, mean, standard deviation).
3. **Data Validation**: The example shows how to check for duplicates in your dataset using `df.duplicated().sum()`. You can customize this according to your specific needs and data. 
4. **Handling Non-Numeric Data (illustration)**: This section includes a function `check_non_numeric_values` that iterates through columns, identifies non-numeric values, and provides warnings if needed.  You should adapt this based on the nature of your dataset and the expected format of your data.
5. **Comments**:  Added comments within the code to explain the purpose of each section, making it easier for others (and you) to understand how the script works. 


**Additional Notes:**

* **Data Transformation (Optional):** You could add more transformation techniques as needed. For instance:
    * Converting strings to dates. 
    * Creating new features from existing ones.  
    * Calculating summaries like averages, percentiles, etc.
